# libFoundation
An Objective-C Foundation library

Section: H's Computer History Museum

Version 1.1, Last Update: 2008-11-02

A lightweight implementation of the OpenStep specification for Linux, Solaris,
and other platforms. Don't base anything on this, if you are looking for an
Objective-C Foundation library look at [GNUstep](http://www.gnustep.org/) -
the Foundation part of that is supposed to be really good by now.
